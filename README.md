## API Docs
- `GET /`: temporary hello world
- `GET /queue`: (Jamie working on it) fetch queue time data from external api, this route is just for demo purpose, fetch queue will eventually work as a helper function we can call when we want to get the current wait time. We should store the data some way after we fetch it.
